# Code Newbie

I created this project to practice pulling data from an API, storing that data in a database, displaying the data in a pretty way, and creating a new API endpoint using the data. Through the project I also hope to provide a forum for others who want to learn about these topics or contribute to an open-source project for the first time. 

### Getting Started ###
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have everything you need to run the program. Doing so in a virtual environment is recommended!

* Create a directory called `secret` with an empty `__init__.py` file inside. Make a `keys.py` file in the `secret` directory (based on the `secretkeys_template.py`) and populate it with your Twitter API credentials.

* I still need to create a seed file for the database for others to get up and running with the project. Stay tuned!
